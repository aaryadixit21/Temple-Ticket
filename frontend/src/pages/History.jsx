      <h2>Temple Construction Fact</h2>
      <h4>Facts about new Shri Ram Janbhoomi temple under construction</h4>
      <p>
        The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of
        construction of the Ram Temple in March 2020. On 25 March 2020, Ram's
        idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of Chief Minister
        Yogi Adityanath.

      <p>
        Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the
        temple free of cost and is the contractor of the project. Central
        Building Research Institute, National Geophysical Research Institute and
        the Indian Institute of Technology (such as those Bombay, Guwahati, and
        Madras) are assisting in areas such as soil testing, concrete and
        design. Reports emerged that the Indian Space Research Organisation
        (ISRO) had identified a stream of the Sarayu which flows under the
        temple. Tata Consulting Engineers has been designated as a project
        management consultant.
